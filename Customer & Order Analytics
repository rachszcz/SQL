#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) =6 
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) =6 
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as f 
ON c.order_id = f.orderID 
WHERE length(orderid) =6 AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(length(orderid) =6 
AND orderid<> 'Order ID');

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) * price AS total_price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * price AS total_revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS f 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS c 
ON c.order_id = f.orderID 
WHERE f.Quantity >2 
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
